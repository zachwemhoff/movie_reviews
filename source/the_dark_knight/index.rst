The acting in *The Dark Knight* is phenomenal, earning it a **Great** rating on
my scale, or 2 stars. Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, and Aaron Eckhart all
produce incredibly compelling performances. The late Heath Ledger, who passed
before the movie was released, won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for best
supporting actor for his role as the Joker. Additionally, his performance earned
him many other awards listed below. His portrayal of the Joker is

interesting. Additionally, the story is easy to follow. The ending leaves
viewers in suspense and with a renewed sense of hope. Therefore, the film scores

Directing
^^^^^^^^^
Director Christopher Nolan did an exceptional job directing *The Dark Knight*,

big name actors that fit their roles perfectly. Additionally, Nolan was able to
create a superhero movie that attracted more than just comic book fans. This
allowed *The Dark Knight* to be regarded as a cinematic masterpiece, and not
just another superhero movie. Therefore, under Christopher Nolan's direction,
this film earns two stars for the "Directing" category.

Visual
^^^^^^
Visually, this film earns the 2 stars and the **Great** rating for this
category. This rating is achieved because of the great one-shot photos that can
be taken from the film as well. In Addition, the film uses impressive CGI,
computer-generated imagery, as well as using real controlled events to impress
in the visual category. One example of this is when Heath Ledger's Joker blows
up Gotham General Hospital the film crew used an actual building that was set to
be destroyed and blew it up themselves. The movie scene can be viewed `here

of it within the visuals of the film are why it earn two stars in the "Visual"

this film that evokes emotion and intrigues the audience. Therefore, this film
