Harry Potter Continued
======================

Ranking the Movies
------------------

In Reverse Order

* Chamber of Secrets
* Sorcererâ€™s Stone
* Prisoner of Azkaban
* Goblet of Fire
* Order of the Phoenix
* Half-Blood Prince
* Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 & 2

This is incredibly difficult to rank some of the best movies of all time.
However, if I were ranking all of the Star Wars movies and all of the Harry
Potter movies, I would rank Star Wars 1-9 right below Harry Potter 1-7.

Choose your friends wisely
In the first movie of the franchise, Harry finds himself in the great hall where
he and the other kids in their class are being sorted into their different
houses. Harry then meets Draco Malfoy, one of the movie's antagonists. Draco
asks if Harry would like to be his friend and part of Slytherin house. Harry
declines and asks the sorting hat to put him in Gryffindor and is friends with
Ron and Hermione. Those friends would stick with Harry until the final Battle
of Hogwarts.

If you need help, ask for it.
One common flaw that Harry Potter has throughout the franchise is that whenever
he is faced with a challenge, he always feels the need to do it alone. However,
each time Harry nearly goes wandering off on his own, his pals Ron and Hermione
always tell him that he needs the other two. Every time it usually ends up
working in their favor.

Death is inevitable but, love is immortal
One of my favorite stories in the movies is Lily Potter protecting her son
Harry with love even after being killed by Voldemort. Even though she was gone,
she saved her son with a charm that saved him from suffering the same fate she
did.

Conclusion
----------

Even though there will never be another Harry Potter movie in theaters, these
movies will always be a favorite of mine and a favorite of so many around the
world. Every once in a while, I will turn these movies on and watch them for
several hours in a row. One day I cannot wait to share them with my children
and hope they enjoy them as I do.
