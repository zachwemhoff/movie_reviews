Iron Man 1
==========

.. warning::
    Movie spoilers

Iron Man is a story about Tony Stark, a genius billionaire who owns his fathers
weaponry company: Stark Industries. It starts by Tony giving a weapons demonstration
in Iraq. He then gets kidnapped in an explosion, leaving him with a major injury
to his chest. He wakes up with a car battery attached to his chest and is being
forced to build a his own missile from a cave in Iraq. He finds a way to build a
battery that can sit inside his chest and keep him alive. He then finds out that
battery can also power a suit, which he builds as his escape route out of there.
Once Tony is back home he works more on the suit and makes essentially the Iron
Man you know of today. However a man named Obadiah Stane, the man who was put in
charge of Stark Industries, wants to use Tony's technology against him.

I personally liked this movie very much. I think Tony's character is very unique
because one moment he is gambling in a casino and he can have such an "I don't
care" attitude, and then the next moment he is building the most insane suit
known to mankind. Tony has a funny personality and keeps that throughout the
movie even in scenarios which you wouldn't think should be comedic, which makes
it that much better. I also love how out of all the typical superheroes, Iron
Man, is a normal human. When I say normal I mean no powers, or superhuman abilities.
Tony is just a genius who uses his resources to help save the world.
