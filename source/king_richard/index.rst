.. warning::
    This movie review may be a spoiler

King Richard is based on the true story of Venus and Serena Williams’s father,
Richard Williams, and their glory to success in tennis. Richard Williams is
determined, persistent, and stubborn in his vision and plans for his daughters
to be the best tennis players in the world. Richard Williams in the film is
played by Will Smith and he does a phenomenal job at portraying Richard Williams
and his family dynamic so well. The film focuses on Richard Williams’ pursuit to
secure a promising future for his daughters and displays the many adversities
faced by families of color in the United States. There is a part in the film
where child-protected services and the police are called on Richard Willams’s
family because someone reported stating that their children were being abused.

Will Smith Performance
----------------------

Will Smith portrayed Richard Williams so well through his transformation to act
and bring out the personality and sense of humor of Richard Williams. Will Smith
was in character throughout the film allowing us to envision Richard Williams
and not an actor trying to impersonate him.

    * Through his accent of Richard Williams and his display of emotions, we were
      able to see where Richard Williams’s values for his family come from.
    * The film focuses on Venus and her glory to excel in tennis through the
      consistent tennis coaching from her father and mother and the private
      coaching in which Richard Williams would seek out the best coaches to
      train her.
    * Richard Williams was always there with his camera recording Venus’s
      sessions for Serena to train from.

Venus and Serena Williams
-------------------------
Throughout the film, we see Serena Williams being in the shadows of Venus
Williams who’s receiving more private training and is assigned to compete at
upper-level tennis matches. We, later on, see Serena competing at competitions
that she secretly signed herself up for without her parent’s knowledge and
surprises them with how good she plays. Richard Williams and Brandi Williams
teach their daughters to be humble and to have good sportsmanship through their
undefeatable wins. Richard did do not let anyone stand in his way of his plans
for his daughter’s success both academically and in their athletics.

Overall Thoughts
----------------
This film overall was a good watch and had many themes surrounding perseverance,
sacrifice, family, and determination. Richard Williams achieved all the plans he
had set for his family and daughter’s success in tennis. I was anticipating
seeing both sides to Venus and Serena’s journey’s to success but the film was
more on Venus which was not bad at all because I was not as familiar with her
as I was with Serena. Hopefully there is a part two of this film to showcase
Serena’s glory to success. *I would recommend this movie for anyone to watch*.
